<p>Δ (delta) connectivity measures between Smed ELAC2 KD and controls
per edge and time point.</p>
<p><strong>Mention in thesis (for traceability):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To identify Smed ELAC2 KD-specific effects, a Δ (delta) connectivity
measure was used between Smed ELAC2 KD and controls per edge and time
point. For each edge, Δ can be positive or negative. A positive Δ means
the connection was stronger in Smed ELAC2 KD than expected from
controls, while a negative Δ means it was weaker. Uncertainty was
assessed by repeated resampling of cells, which provided confidence
intervals for Δ (Section 3.16; Supplementary Table S7). For the
family-level visualization, edges with very small absolute changes were
ignored, specifically, changes with |Δ| &lt; 0.003 were treated as
negligible for the summary plot (Figure 32).</p>
